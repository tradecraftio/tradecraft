This is a special purpose release of the pre-segwit, pre-auxpow v12 branch of
the Tradecraft/Freicoin client for intended use within various infrastructure
projects that require a v12 or earlier release.  Upgrading is necessary for
those who need to continue using v12 releases, but upgrading to v13.2.4-11864 or
higher is *highly* recommended wherever possible.

WARNING
=======

The v12 branch does not distinguish between the protocol-cleanup rule changes
and the relaxation of aggregate block limits in the size-expansion flag day.
Since v12 branch clients also do not support the auxiliary proof-of-work rules
either, it is trivial for a malicious peer to perform a disk-space exhausting
denial of service attack against v12 peers once the protocol-cleanup rule change
activates on April 16th, 2021.

If you must run a v12 client, it is recommended that you firewall it behind
another client which supports the auxiliary proof-of-work soft-fork, which was
first released in v13.2.4-11864.  To help ensure that your v12 client does not
connect to unknown peers, starting with this release will refuse to start unless
it is configured to connect to a trusted peer with the `-connect` command line
or configuration file option.  It is up to you to ensure that the node it
connects to is properly updated.

How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Freicoin-Qt (on Mac) or
freicoind/freicoin-qt (on Linux).

Notable changes
===============

Updated protocol-cleanup rule change flag day
---------------------------------------------

The v13.2.4-11864 release took advantage of the deployment of auxiliary
proof-of-work (AKA "merge-mining") to speed the activation of the protocol-
cleanup rule changes, with the final date for activation chosen to be April
16th, 2021 in the v13.2.5-11909 release.  This support release of the v12 client
includes this updated flag day activation parameters.

Known bugs
==========

Split protocol-cleanup and size-expansion rule changes in future releases
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since a safe mechanism for handling block-size increases has yet to be written,
those constraint relaxations have been split into a separate rule-change to be
activated at some point in the future, no earlier than September 2nd, 2022.

However this split of the protocol-cleanup rule change into two separate
activation flag days has NOT been back-ported to the v12 branch.  This release
activates both the protocol-cleanup and size-expansion rule changes on April
16th, 2021.

Because of this, all v12 clients (including this and earlier releases) are
vulnerable to disk-filling DoS attacks by untrusted peers.  If you must run a
v12 client, it is essential to make sure the node only connects to trusted
peers.  For this reason, starting with this release the client will refuse to
start up if the `-connect` configuration option is not set.  Please use
`-connect` to make sure your v12 node is connected to a v13.2.4-11864 or later
peer that you control.
