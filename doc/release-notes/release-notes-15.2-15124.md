How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Freicoin-Qt` (on Mac) or `freicoind`/`freicoin-qt` (on Linux).

The first time you run version v15.2-15124 or higher, a full reindex will be required which converts your chainstate database and block undo files to a new format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour, depending on the speed of your machine, and require re-downloading the block chain if you are running a full node.

The file format of `fee_estimates.dat` changed in version v15.2-15124. Hence, a downgrade from version v15.2-15124 or upgrade to version v15.2-15124 will cause all fee estimates to be discarded.

### Downgrading warning

The chainstate database for this release is not compatible with previous releases, so if you run v15.2-15124 and then decide to switch back to any older version, you will need to run the old release with the `-reindex` option to rebuild the chainstate data structures and block-undo files in the old format.

If your node has pruning enabled, this will entail re-downloading and processing the entire blockchain.

Compatibility
-------------

Freicoin is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. Windows XP is not supported.

Freicoin should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not frequently tested on them.

Notes for v15.2-15124
---------------------

### Current SegWit support

Version v15.2-15124 supports adding a segregated witness address via the `addwitnessaddress` RPC, but please note that this is a testing/expert RPC, which does not guarantee recovery from backup.  Only use this RPC if you know what you are doing. More complete wallet support for segregated witness is coming in a future release.

### Rescanning with encrypted wallets

As in previous versions, when using an encrypted HD wallet, the keypool cannot be topped up without unlocking the wallet. This means that currently, in order to recover from a backup of an encrypted HD wallet, the user must unlock the wallet with a really long timeout and manually trigger a rescan, otherwise they risk missing some keys when auto-topup cannot run. Unfortunately there is no `rescan` RPC in this version, that will be included in a future version, so for now a rescan can be triggered using one of the `import*` commands, using a dummy address generated by another (trusted) wallet.

Notable changes
---------------

### Network fork safety enhancements

A number of changes to the way Freicoin deals with peer connections and invalid blocks have been made, as a safety precaution against blockchain forks and misbehaving peers.

- Unrequested blocks with less work than the minimum-chain-work are now no longer processed even if they have more work than the tip (a potential issue during IBD where the tip may have low-work).  This prevents peers wasting the resources of a node.

- Peers which provide a chain with less work than the minimum-chain-work during IBD will now be disconnected.

- For a given outbound peer, we now check whether their best known block has at least as much work as our tip.  If it doesn't, and if we still haven't heard about a block with sufficient work after a 20 minute timeout, then we send a single getheaders message, and wait 2 more minutes.  If after two minutes their best known block has insufficient work, we disconnect that peer.  We protect 4 of our outbound peers from being disconnected by this logic to prevent excessive network topology changes as a result of this algorithm, while still ensuring that we have a reasonable number of nodes not known to be on bogus chains.

- Outbound (non-manual) peers that serve us block headers that are already known to be invalid (other than compact block announcements, because BIP 152 explicitly permits nodes to relay compact blocks before fully validating them) will now be disconnected.

- If the chain tip has not been advanced for over 30 minutes, we now assume the tip may be stale and will try to connect to an additional outbound peer.  A periodic check ensures that if this extra peer connection is in use, we will disconnect the peer that least recently announced a new block.

- The set of all known invalid-themselves blocks (i.e. blocks which we attempted to connect but which were found to be invalid) are now tracked and used to check if new headers build on an invalid chain. This ensures that everything that descends from an invalid block is marked as such.

### Performance Improvements

Version v15.2-15124 contains a number of significant performance improvements, which make Initial Block Download, startup, transaction and block validation much faster:

- The chainstate database (which is used for tracking UTXOs) has been changed from a per-transaction model to a per-output model (See [Bitcoin PR 10195](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10195)).  Advantages of this model are that it:

    - avoids the CPU overhead of deserializing and serializing the unused outputs;

    - has more predictable memory usage;

    - uses simpler code;

    - is adaptable to various future cache flushing strategies.

  As a result, validating the blockchain during Initial Block Download (IBD) and reindex is ~30-40% faster, uses 10-20% less memory, and flushes to disk far less frequently.  The only downside is that the on-disk database is 15% larger.  During the conversion from the previous format a few extra gigabytes may be used.

- Earlier versions experienced a spike in memory usage while flushing UTXO updates to disk.  As a result, only half of the available memory was actually used as cache, and the other half was reserved to accommodate flushing.  This is no longer the case (See [Bitcoin PR 10148](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10148)), and the entirety of the available cache (see `-dbcache`) is now actually used as cache.  This reduces the flushing frequency by a factor 2 or more.

- In previous versions, signature validation for transactions has been cached when the transaction is accepted to the mempool.  Release v15.2-15124 extends this to cache the entire script validity (See [Bitcoin PR 10192](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10192)).  This means that if a transaction in a block has already been accepted to the mempool, the scriptSig does not need to be re-evaluated.  Empirical tests show that this results in new block validation being 40-50% faster.

- LevelDB has been upgraded to version 1.20 (See [Bitcoin PR 10544](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10544)).  This version contains hardware acceleration for CRC on architectures supporting SSE 4.2.  As a result, synchronization and block validation are now faster.

- SHA256 hashing has been optimized for architectures supporting SSE 4 (See [Bitcoin PR 10821](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10821)).  SHA256 is around 50% faster on supported hardware, which results in around 5% faster IBD and block validation.  In version v15.2-15124, SHA256 hardware optimization is disabled in release builds by default, but can be enabled by using `--enable-experimental-asm` when building.

- Refill of the keypool no longer flushes the wallet between each key which resulted in a ~20x speedup in creating a new wallet.  Part of this speedup was used to increase the default keypool to 1000 keys to make recovery more robust.  (See [Bitcoin PR 10831](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10831)).

### Fee Estimation Improvements

Fee estimation has been significantly improved in version v15.2-15124, with more accurate fee estimates used by the wallet and a wider range of options for advanced users of the `estimatesmartfee` and `estimaterawfee` RPCs (See [Bitcoin PR 10199](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10199)).

##### Changes to internal logic and wallet behavior

- Internally, estimates are now tracked on 3 different time horizons. This allows for longer targets and means estimates adjust more quickly to changes in conditions.

- Estimates can now be *conservative* or *economical*.  *Conservative* estimates use longer time horizons to produce an estimate which is less susceptible to rapid changes in fee conditions.  *Economical* estimates use shorter time horizons and will be more affected by short-term changes in fee conditions.  Economical estimates may be considerably lower during periods of low transaction activity (for example over weekends), but may result in transactions being unconfirmed if prevailing fees increase rapidly.

- By default, the wallet will use conservative fee estimates to increase the reliability of transactions being confirmed within the desired target.  For transactions that are marked as replaceable, the wallet will use an economical estimate by default, since the fee can be 'bumped' if the fee conditions change rapidly (See [Bitcoin PR 10589](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10589)).

- Estimates can now be made for confirmation targets up to 1008 blocks (1.5 weeks).

- More data on historical fee rates is stored, leading to more precise fee estimates.

- Transactions which leave the mempool due to eviction or other non-confirmed reasons are now taken into account by the fee estimation logic, leading to more accurate fee estimates.

- The fee estimation logic will make sure enough data has been gathered to return a meaningful estimate.  If there is insufficient data, a fallback default fee is used.

##### Changes to fee estimate RPCs

- The `estimatefee` RPC is now deprecated in favor of using only `estimatesmartfee` (which is the implementation used by the GUI)

- The `estimatesmartfee` RPC interface has been changed (See [Bitcoin PR 10707](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10707)):

    - The `nblocks` argument has been renamed to `conf_target` (to be consistent with other RPC methods).

    - An `estimate_mode` argument has been added.  This argument takes one of the following strings: `CONSERVATIVE`, `ECONOMICAL` or `UNSET` (which defaults to `CONSERVATIVE`).

    - The RPC return object now contains an `errors` member, which returns errors encountered during processing.

    - If Freicoin has not been running for long enough and has not seen enough blocks or transactions to produce an accurate fee estimation, an error will be returned (previously a value of -1 was used to indicate an error, which could be confused for a feerate).

- A new `estimaterawfee` RPC is added to provide raw fee data.  External clients can query and use this data in their own fee estimation logic.

### Multi-wallet support

Freicoin now supports loading multiple, separate wallets (See [Bitcoin PR 8694](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8694) and [Bitcoin PR 10849](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10849)).  The wallets are completely separated, with individual balances, keys and received transactions.

Multi-wallet is enabled by using more than one `-wallet` argument when starting Freicoin, either on the command line or in the Freicoin config file.

**In Freicoin-Qt, only the first wallet will be displayed and accessible for creating and signing transactions.** GUI selectable multiple wallets will be supported in a future version.  However, even in v15.2-15124 other loaded wallets will remain synchronized to the node's current tip in the background.  This can be useful if running a pruned node, since loading a wallet where the most recent sync is beyond the pruned height results in having to download and revalidate the whole blockchain.  Continuing to synchronize all wallets in the background avoids this problem.

Freicoin v15.2-15124 contains the following changes to the RPC interface and `freicoin-cli` for multi-wallet:

* When running Freicoin with a single wallet, there are **no** changes to the RPC interface or `freicoin-cli`.  All RPC calls and `freicoin-cli` commands continue to work as before.

* When running Freicoin with multi-wallet, all *node-level* RPC methods continue to work as before.  HTTP RPC requests should be send to the normal `<RPC IP address>:<RPC port>` endpoint, and `freicoin-cli` commands should be run as before.  A *node-level* RPC method is any method which does not require access to the wallet.

* When running Freicoin with multi-wallet, *wallet-level* RPC methods must specify the wallet for which they're intended in every request.  HTTP RPC requests should be send to the `<RPC IP address>:<RPC port>/wallet/<wallet name>` endpoint, for example `127.0.0.1:8332/wallet/wallet1.dat`.  `freicoin-cli` commands should be run with a `-rpcwallet` option, for example `freicoin-cli -rpcwallet=wallet1.dat getbalance`.

* A new *node-level* `listwallets` RPC method is added to display which wallets are currently loaded.  The names returned by this method are the same as those used in the HTTP endpoint and for the `rpcwallet` argument.

Note that while multi-wallet is now fully supported, the RPC multi-wallet interface should be considered unstable for version v15.2-15124, and there may backwards-incompatible changes in future versions.

### Duplicate wallets disallowed

Previously, it was possible to open the same wallet twice by manually copying the wallet file, causing issues when both were opened simultaneously.  It is no longer possible to open copies of the same wallet.

### Bump fee from the GUI

Freicoin has supported transaction replacement since version v12.1-10123, and since version v14.3-13381 has included a `bumpfee` RPC method to replace unconfirmed transactions with a new transaction that pays a higher fee.

In version v15.2-15124, replacing the unconfirmed transaction with a higher-fee transaction is both supported in the GUI as well (See [Bitcoin PR 9592](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9592)).

### Removal of Coin Age Priority

In previous versions of Freicoin, a portion of each block could be reserved for transactions based on the age and value of UTXOs they spent.  This concept (Coin Age Priority) is a policy choice by miners, and there are no consensus rules around the inclusion of Coin Age Priority transactions in blocks.  In practice, only a few miners continue to use Coin Age Priority for transaction selection in blocks.  Freicoin v15.2-15124 removes all remaining support for Coin Age Priority (See [Bitcoin PR 9602](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9602)).  This has the following implications:

- The concept of *free transactions* has been removed.  High Coin Age Priority transactions would previously be allowed to be relayed even if they didn't attach a miner fee.  This is no longer possible since there is no concept of Coin Age Priority.  The `-limitfreerelay` and `-relaypriority` options which controlled relay of free transactions have therefore been removed.

- The `-sendfreetransactions` option has been removed, since almost all miners do not include transactions which do not attach a transaction fee.

- The `-blockprioritysize` option has been removed.

- The `estimatepriority` and `estimatesmartpriority` RPCs have been removed.

- The `getmempoolancestors`, `getmempooldescendants`, `getmempoolentry` and `getrawmempool` RPCs no longer return `startingpriority` and `currentpriority`.

- The `prioritisetransaction` RPC no longer takes a `priority_delta` argument, which is replaced by a `dummy` argument for backwards compatibility with clients using positional arguments.  The RPC is still used to change the apparent fee-rate of the transaction by using the `fee_delta` argument.

- `-minrelaytxfee` can now be set to 0.  If `minrelaytxfee` is set, then fees smaller than `minrelaytxfee` (per kB) are rejected from relaying, mining and transaction creation.  This defaults to 1000 satoshi/kB.

- The `-printpriority` option has been updated to only output the fee rate and hash of transactions included in a block by the mining code.

### Mempool Persistence Across Restarts

Version v14.3-13381 introduced mempool persistence across restarts (the mempool is saved to a `mempool.dat` file in the data directory prior to shutdown and restores the mempool when the node is restarted).  Version v15.2-15124 allows this feature to be switched on or off using the `-persistmempool` command-line option (See [Bitcoin PR 9966](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9966)).  By default, the option is set to true, and the mempool is saved on shutdown and reloaded on startup.  If set to false, the `mempool.dat` file will not be loaded on startup or saved on shutdown.

### Miner block size limiting deprecated

Though blockmaxweight has been preferred for limiting the size of blocks returned by getblocktemplate since v13.2-11780, blockmaxsize remained as an option for those who wished to limit their block size directly.  Using this option resulted in a few UI issues as well as non-optimal fee selection and ever-so-slightly worse performance, and has thus now been deprecated.  Further, the blockmaxsize option is now used only to calculate an implied blockmaxweight, instead of limiting block size directly.  Any miners who wish to limit their blocks by size, instead of by weight, will have to do so manually by removing transactions from their block template directly.

### GUI settings backed up on reset

The GUI settings will now be written to `guisettings.ini.bak` in the data directory before wiping them when the `-resetguisettings` argument is used.  This can be used to retroactively troubleshoot issues due to the GUI settings.

### Debug `-minimumchainwork` argument added

A hidden debug argument `-minimumchainwork` has been added to allow a custom minimum work value to be used when validating a chain.

### New RPC methods

Version v15.2-15124 introduces several new RPC methods:

- `abortrescan` stops current wallet rescan, e.g. when triggered by an `importprivkey` call (See [Bitcoin PR 10208](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10208)).

- `combinerawtransaction` accepts a JSON array of raw transactions and combines them into a single raw transaction (See [Bitcoin PR 10571](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10571)).

- `estimaterawfee` returns raw fee data so that customized logic can be implemented to analyze the data and calculate estimates.  See [Fee Estimation Improvements](#fee-estimation-improvements) for full details on changes to the fee estimation logic and interface.

- `getchaintxstats` returns statistics about the total number and rate of transactions in the chain (See [Bitcoin PR 9733](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9733)).

- `listwallets` lists wallets which are currently loaded. See the *Multi-wallet* section of these release notes for full details (See [Multi-wallet support](#multi-wallet-support)).

- `uptime` returns the total runtime of the `freicoind` server since its last start (See [Bitcoin PR 10400](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10400)).

### Low-level RPC changes

- When using Freicoin in multi-wallet mode, RPC requests for wallet methods must specify the wallet that they're intended for.  See [Multi-wallet support](#multi-wallet-support) for full details.

- The new database model no longer stores information about transaction versions of unspent outputs (See [Performance improvements](#performance-improvements)).  This means that:

  - The `gettxout` RPC no longer has a `version` field in the response.

  - The `gettxoutsetinfo` RPC reports `hash_serialized_2` instead of `hash_serialized`, which does not commit to the transaction versions of unspent outputs, but does commit to the height and coinbase information.

  - The `getutxos` REST path no longer reports the `txvers` field in JSON format, and always reports 0 for transaction versions in the binary format

- The `estimatefee` RPC is deprecated.  Clients should switch to using the `estimatesmartfee` RPC, which returns better fee estimates.  See [Fee Estimation Improvements](#fee-estimation-improvements) for full details on changes to the fee estimation logic and interface.

- The `gettxoutsetinfo` response now contains `disk_size` and `bogosize` instead of `bytes_serialized`.  The first is a more accurate estimate of actual disk usage, but is not deterministic.  The second is unrelated to disk usage, but is a database-independent metric of UTXO set size: it counts every UTXO entry as 50 + the length of its scriptPubKey (See [Bitcoin PR 10426](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10426)).

- `signrawtransaction` can no longer be used to combine multiple transactions into a single transaction.  Instead, use the new `combinerawtransaction` RPC (See [Bitcoin PR 10571](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10571)).

- `fundrawtransaction` no longer accepts a `reserveChangeKey` option.  This option used to allow RPC users to fund a raw transaction using a key from the keypool for the change address without removing it from the available keys in the keypool.  The key could then be re-used for a `getnewaddress` call, which could potentially result in confusing or dangerous behaviour (See [Bitcoin PR 10784](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10784)).

- `estimatepriority` and `estimatesmartpriority` have been removed.  See [Removal of Coin Age Priority](#removal-of-coin-age-priority).

- The `listunspent` RPC now takes a `query_options` argument (see [Bitcoin PR 8952](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8952)), which is a JSON object containing one or more of the following members:

  - `minimumAmount` - a number specifying the minimum value of each UTXO

  - `maximumAmount` - a number specifying the maximum value of each UTXO

  - `maximumCount` - a number specifying the minimum number of UTXOs

  - `minimumSumAmount` - a number specifying the minimum sum value of all UTXOs

- The `getmempoolancestors`, `getmempooldescendants`, `getmempoolentry` and `getrawmempool` RPCs no longer return `startingpriority` and `currentpriority`.  See [Removal of Coin Age Priority](#removal-of-coin-age-priority).

- The `dumpwallet` RPC now returns the full absolute path to the dumped wallet.  It used to return no value, even if successful (See [Bitcoin PR 9740](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9740)).

- In the `getpeerinfo` RPC, the return object for each peer now returns an `addrbind` member, which contains the ip address and port of the connection to the peer.  This is in addition to the `addrlocal` member which contains the ip address and port of the local node as reported by the peer (See [Bitcoin PR 10478](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10478)).

- The `disconnectnode` RPC can now disconnect a node specified by node ID (as well as by IP address/port).  To disconnect a node based on node ID, call the RPC with the new `nodeid` argument (See [Bitcoin PR 10143](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10143)).

- The second argument in `prioritisetransaction` has been renamed from `priority_delta` to `dummy` since Freicoin no longer has a concept of coin age priority.  The `dummy` argument has no functional effect, but is retained for positional argument compatibility.  See [Removal of Coin Age Priority](#removal-of-coin-age-priority).

- The `resendwallettransactions` RPC throws an error if the `-walletbroadcast` option is set to false (See [Bitcoin PR 10995](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10995)).

- The second argument in the `submitblock` RPC argument has been renamed from`parameters` to `dummy`.  This argument never had any effect, and the renaming is simply to communicate this fact to the user (See [Bitcoin PR 10191](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10191)) (Clients should, however, use positional arguments for `submitblock` in order to be compatible with BIP 22.)

- The `verbose` argument of `getblock` has been renamed to `verbosity` and now takes an integer from 0 to 2.  Verbose level 0 is equivalent to `verbose=false`.  Verbose level 1 is equivalent to `verbose=true`.  Verbose level 2 will give the full transaction details of each transaction in the output as given by `getrawtransaction`.  The old behavior of using the `verbose` named argument and a boolean value is still maintained for compatibility.

- Error codes have been updated to be more accurate for the following error cases (See [Bitcoin PR 9853](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/9853)):

  - `getblock` now returns RPC_MISC_ERROR if the block can't be found on disk (for example if the block has been pruned).  Previously returned RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR.

  - `pruneblockchain` now returns RPC_MISC_ERROR if the blocks cannot be pruned because the node is not in pruned mode.  Previously returned RPC_METHOD_NOT_FOUND.

  - `pruneblockchain` now returns RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER if the blocks cannot be pruned because the supplied timestamp is too late.  Previously returned RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR.

  - `pruneblockchain` now returns RPC_MISC_ERROR if the blocks cannot be pruned because the blockchain is too short.  Previously returned RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR.

  - `setban` now returns RPC_CLIENT_INVALID_IP_OR_SUBNET if the supplied IP address or subnet is invalid.  Previously returned RPC_CLIENT_NODE_ALREADY_ADDED.

  - `setban` now returns RPC_CLIENT_INVALID_IP_OR_SUBNET if the user tries to unban a node that has not previously been banned.  Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.

  - `removeprunedfunds` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if `freicoind` is unable to remove the transaction.  Previously returned RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR.

  - `removeprunedfunds` now returns RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER if the transaction does not exist in the wallet.  Previously returned RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR.

  - `fundrawtransaction` now returns RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY if an invalid change address is provided.  Previously returned RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER.

  - `fundrawtransaction` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if `freicoind` is unable to create the transaction. The error message provides further details.  Previously returned RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR.

  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER if the provided transaction has descendants in the wallet.  Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.

  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER if the provided transaction has descendants in the mempool.  Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.

  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the provided transaction has has been mined or conflicts with a mined transaction.  Previously returned RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY.

  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the provided transaction has already been bumped by a different transaction.  Previously returned RPC_INVALID_REQUEST.

  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the provided transaction contains inputs which don't belong to this wallet.  Previously returned RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY.

  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the provided transaction has multiple change outputs.  Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.

  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the provided transaction has no change output.  Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.

  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the fee is too high.  Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.

  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the fee is too low.  Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.

  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the change output is too small to bump the fee.  Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.

- The "currentblocksize" value in getmininginfo has been removed.

- `dumpwallet` no longer allows overwriting files.  This is a security measure as well as prevents dangerous user mistakes.

- `backupwallet` will now fail when attempting to backup to source file, rather than destroying the wallet.

- `listsinceblock` will now throw an error if an unknown `blockhash` argument value is passed, instead of returning a list of all wallet transactions since the genesis block.  The behaviour is unchanged when an empty string is provided.
