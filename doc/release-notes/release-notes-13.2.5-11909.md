This is a new patch release, containing a changes to the auxiliary proof-of-work
(AKA "merge mining") support in the built-in stratum server for the purpose of
supporting merge-mining in conjunction with an appropriately configured bitcoind
instance.  Upgrading is not required.

Notable changes
===============

The recently released v13.2-11780 features activation parameters for the
segregated witness (segwit) soft-fork, and dropped support for Microsoft
Windows XP and macOS 10.7.  Please see the comprehensive notes accompanying
v13.2-11780 for more information.

The recently released v13.2.4-11864 features activation parameters for the
auxiliary proof-of-work (AKA "merge mining") soft-fork.  Please see the release
notes accompanying v13.2.4-11864 for more information.

Merge-mining stratum server support
-----------------------------------

Release v13.2.4-11864 introduced the auxiliary proof-of-work soft-fork, which
has since activated on both testnet and mainnet.  The auxiliary proof-of-work
changes allow for merge-mining, where a single proof-of-work computation for a
Bitcoin block is reused for Tradecraft, or other chains.  However previously
released versions were not configured to support actual merge-mining.  This
release adds that capability, by introducing 4 new stratum server methods,
modifying one existing method, and adding one new notification method.

First, the 3 new server methods having to do with initialization:

- "mining.aux.subscribe"
  Returns: aux_pow_path MAX_COMMIT_BRANCH_LENGTH MAX_BRANCH_LENGTH

  This method takes no parameters, and merely indicates to the server that the
  client supports the merge-mining extensions.  Once received, the server will
  stop sending "mining.notify" messages for the auxiliary proof-of-work stage.
  It will only send a traditional "mining.notify" for the second-stage native
  proof-of-work.

  The return value is the auxiliary proof-of-work commitment path (a 256-bit
  value fixed for each chain), and the two consensus-critical chain parameters
  which limit auxiliary proof sizes: the maximum number of hashes in a commit
  branch proof, and the maximum number of hashes in the auxiliary (Bitcoin)
  transaction branch proof.

- "minign.aux.authorize" username [password]
  Returns: string

  This method takes a username which is a Tradecraft address (with a possible
  suffixed minimum difficulty constraint), and adds that address to the list of
  current miners.  Newly generated work will be customized to that address in
  future "mining.aux.notify" messages (see below).  A password option is present
  but not currently used.

  When auxiliary work notifications are sent, the work for this user will be
  identified by the canonical representation of the Tradecraft address, as
  achieved by round-trip conversions of the username field to CFreicoinAddress
  and back.  For convenience, the resulting string representation is returned to
  the callee.

- "mining.aux.deauthorize" username
  Returns: bool

  This method removes the specified username (Tradecraft address) from the list
  of miners.  It returns true if the address was previously registered, or false
  if it was not recognized.

Now the methods for notifying the client of auxiliary work, and for submitting
solved auxiliary shares to the server:

- "mining.aux.notify" job_id commits nBits bias
  Returns: ignored

  The auxiliary work notification, which sends merge-mining commitments to the
  client, one for each authorized miner.

  The first parameter is a string which identifies the work template, and must
  be kept verbatim for it is used in the submission of work.

  The second parameter is a JSON object mapping addresses (corresponding to the
  authorized miners) to 256-bit commitment hashes.

  The third and fourth parameters are the pseudo-nBits and a bias value (between
  0 and 7) representing the work target.

- "mining.aux.submit" username job_id commit_branch midstate_hash
                      midstate_buffer midstate_length lock_time aux_branch
                      num_txns nVersion hashPrevBlock nTime nBits nNonce
  Returns: bool

  Submits an auxiliary proof-of-work share for consideration.  Returns true if
  the share was received without error.

  The username is a Tradecraft address identifying the authorized miner, and the
  job_id is the value specified in the work notification message.  The remaining
  parameters are the auxiliary proof-of-work data structure.

- "mining.submit" ... nVersion extranonce1
  Returns: bool

  The regular "mining.submit" method is modified to take one extra parameter,
  which specifies the extranonce1 string.  Normally the extranonce1 string is
  determined by the connection metadata, but in a merge-mining setup the second
  stage proof-of-work is potentially relayed to another miner by the upstream
  merge-mining stratum server.  We don't know what extranonce1 value will be in
  use by that miner, so we allow it to be specified during work submission.

  For similar reasons, the nVersion parameter is unconstrained when submitting
  second-stage shares.  We don't know what version-bits configuration is
  negotiated by the client, so we accept any value without masking.

Support for these merge-mining extensions is optional, and should not disrupt
existing use of the stratum server for dedicated / non-merged mining.

Delay protocol-cleanup rule change
----------------------------------

The set of protocol-cleanup rule changes is currently scheduled to activate
January 16th, 2021.  It is, however, designed to be safely pushed back so long
as a majority of miners agree to do so.  Out of concern that further integration
tests ought to be done before activation, this release pushes back activation on
mainnet until April 16th, 2021.

At the time of release, this change of the activation date has already been
adopted by a majority of the hashrate.  This official release serves to protect
other users as well.

v13.2.5-11909 Change log
========================

The following pull requests were merged into the Tradecraft code repository for
this release.

- #90 Add auxiliary subscription capability, for bitcoin merge-mining

  This pull request accomplishes a couple of tasks:

  - Relicense the stratum subsystem under the terms of the Mozilla Public
    License 2.0, which allows it to be extracted and used in Bitcoin Core
    without engaging the GPL's viral clauses.  This is, in principle, something
    that is not to be done lightly, since those GPL clauses protect the rights
    of users.  However in this instance Mark Friedenbach, the sole author of the
    stratum subsystem, deemed that the presumed greater adoption of merged
    mining benefits all to a larger degree.

  - Add auxiliary work registration to the stratum mining subsystem.  This
    allows a single stratum connection to be used for connecting the auxiliary
    chain (bitcoind) to the freicoin miner, and for multiplexing multiple mining
    users along that connection. Auxiliary commitments are compactly served to
    the upstream miner, while still reporting second-stage work units as needed.

  - Allow the specification of `extranonce1` and an unconstrained `nVersion` on
    submission, since the merge-mined chain has little control over what
    extranonce and version bits are set by the upstream miner.

  - A large number of small fixes to the stratum mining subsystem to improve
    performance, stability, and logging.

  This PR adds sufficient capability to serve work to upstream merge-mining
  servers implemented in Bitcoin Core. There will be a separate PR to add this
  capability to the `bitcoin-merge-mining-13` and later branches of the
  tradecraft repository.
