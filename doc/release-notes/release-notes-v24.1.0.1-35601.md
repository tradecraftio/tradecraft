How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on macOS) or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).

Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated.  Old wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.

Compatibility
-------------

Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as frequently tested on them. It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems.

Notable changes
---------------

There have been upstream changes between v24.0.1.2-35544 and this release.  Please see the Bitcoin Core release notes for notable changes between the upstream versions upon which these releases are based.

In addition, the following changes have been made specifically to the Tradecraft/Freicoin merge-mining patch set.

### Fixed delay on shutdown due to wallet lock

A longstanding bug in the merge-mining patch set has been fixed that caused the wallet to be remain deadlocked on shutdown, triggering a long timeout delay before shutdown can complete.  Shutdown/restart of Bitcoin Core server with stratum and merge-mining patches applied should now be much faster.

### Switch to libevent for watchdog timer

The merge-mining patch set has been updated to use libevent for the watchdog timer, instead of the custom timer implementation used previously.  This allows processing to continue while the watchdog timer is running, thereby preventing delays when new work arrives.

### New RPC: getstratuminfo

A new RPC `getstratuminfo` has been added to the stratum mining server.  This RPC returns information about the stratum mining server's configuration and connected miners.

### New RPC: getmergemineinfo

A new RPC `getmergemineinfo` has been added to the stratum mining server.  This RPC returns information about connected auxiliary work servers, and the current state of the merge mining system.
