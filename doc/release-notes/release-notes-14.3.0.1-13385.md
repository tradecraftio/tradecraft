v14.3.0.1-13385 Release Notes
=============================

Freicoin version v14.3.0.1-13385 is now available from:

  https://github.com/tradecraftio/tradecraft/releases/tag/v14.3.0.1-13385

This is a new patch release, containing a critical fix to the p2p block transmission code to fix a bug which prevents merge-mined blocks from being communicated to older clients.  Upgrading is highly recommended for nodes running v13.2.4-11864 or later releases.

Compatibility
-------------

Freicoin is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support), No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues.  Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

Freicoin should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not frequently tested on them.

Notable changes
---------------

The v13.2.4-11864 release introduced the auxiliary proof-of-work (AKA "merge mining") soft-fork, which has since activated on both testnet and mainnet.  Please see the release notes accompanying v13.2.4-11864 for more information.  Unbeknownst by anyone at the time, a bug in the serialization & p2p network code prevented auxiliary proof-of-work data structures from being stripped from block headers before being transmitted directly to non-segwit supporting clients (v12 or earlier).

Headers sent to more recent segwit-supporting nodes would be properly stripped and those nodes could relay the blocks to older clients, so this bug went unnoticed for some time.  Now that nodes supporting segwit but not auxiliary proof-of-work are becoming more infrequent, it was observed that v12 and earlier nodes are having trouble syncing from the network.

Although v12 and earlier nodes are not generally supported, this emergency patch release nevertheless fixes this serialization bug in order to re-enable syncing directly to these pre-segwit nodes.

Upgrading is highly recommended for all nodes currently running clients between v13.2.4-11864 and v14.3-13381.

Known Bugs
----------

Starting with v14.3-13381, the approximate transaction fee shown in Freicoin-Qt when using coin control and smart fee estimation does not reflect any change in target from the smart fee slider.  It will only present an approximate fee calculated using the default target.  The fee calculated using the correct target is still applied to the transaction and shown in the final send confirmation dialog.
