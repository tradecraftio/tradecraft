Compatibility
=============

Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using the Linux
kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th,
2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support), No
attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you
can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities
and issues.  Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
frequently tested on them.

Notable changes
===============

There have been no notable changes in the stratum mining server or the
Tradecraft/Freicoin merge-mining patches between v0.13.2.1-11580 and this
release.  Please see the Bitcoin Core release notes for notable changes between
the upstream versions upon which these releases are based.

Known Bugs
==========

Since 0.14.0 the approximate transaction fee shown in Bitcoin-Qt when using coin
control and smart fee estimation does not reflect any change in target from the
smart fee slider.  It will only present an approximate fee calculated using the
default target.  The fee calculated using the correct target is still applied to
the transaction and shown in the final send confirmation dialog.
