How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on macOS) or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).

Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated.  Old wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.

Compatibility
-------------

Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 11.0+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as frequently tested on them.  It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems.

Notable changes
---------------

There have been no notable changes in the stratum mining server or the Tradecraft/Freicoin merge-mining patches between v25.1.0.1-37413 and this release.  Please see the Bitcoin Core release notes for notable changes between the upstream versions upon which these releases are based.
