How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes in some cases), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on macOS) or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).

Upgrading directly from a version of Bitcoin Core that has reached its EOL is possible, but it might take some time if the data directory needs to be migrated.  Old wallet versions of Bitcoin Core are generally supported.

Compatibility
-------------

Bitcoin Core is supported and extensively tested on operating systems using the Linux kernel, macOS 10.15+, and Windows 7 and newer.  Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not as frequently tested on them. It is not recommended to use Bitcoin Core on unsupported systems.

Notable changes
---------------

As a patch release, v24.0.1.2-35544 contains new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements specific to the stratum mining server and Tradecraft/Freicoin merge-mining patches.  Specifically, v24.0.1.2-35544 adds two major improvements to the stratum mining server:

### Merge-mining multiple chains

The stratum mining server now supports merge-mining multiple chains at once. This is a capability which was always supported by the merge-mining protocol, but required some code changes to enable.  The stratum mining server now supports merge-mining not just Bitcoin and Tradecraft/Freicoin at the same time, but also the Tradecraft/Freicoin testnet, any other chains that support the merge-mining protocol.

To merge-mine multiple chains at once, simply include the authorization information for all chains in a comma-separated list as the stratum authentication password. For example:

    $ cgminer -o stratum+tcp://[host]:[port]
              -u bc1qabc
              -p freicoin:fc1qdef,testnet:tc1qxyz

### Default authorization credentials

Users of the stratum mining server provide a bitcoin address to receive the bitcoin block reward, and a Tradecraft/Freicoin address to authenticate with the merge-mined chain's stratum server for its block reward.  Previously the bitcoin address as username was required, and the Tradecraft/Freicoin address was necessary for the user to merge-mine Tradecraft/Freicoin.  With this release, the stratum mining server now supports authorization defaults.

If the stratum miner does not provide a username (or the username field is empty), then the configuration option `-defaultminingaddress` is used as the bitcoin address for that user.  If this configuration option is not set, then the option `-stratumwallet` specifies the name of a wallet from which to generate an address (or if given a non-zero value that does not correspond to a wallet, then the default/first wallet is used).  When used in this mode, a new address is generated for each found block.

Merge-mining defaults can similarly be specified with the `-mergeminedefault` option, which takes a name/chain ID, a username/address, and an optional password to be used to authenticate with the merge-mined chain's stratum server.  This configuration option may be repeated to provide defaults for different chains.

Finally, the merge-mining auxiliary work server itself can specify a default username and password to use for all clients which have not specified their own credentials for that chain.  In that case, these credentials are used for miners which do not provide their own credentials (unless `-mergeminedefault` is also specified for that chain, which overrides the auxiliary server).
