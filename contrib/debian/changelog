    * Remove multi-precision logic entirely, thereby removing dependencies on
      the external libraries GMP and MPFR. Integer math only is used for both
      initial block download and sync at tip.

freicoin (0.8.6.1~precise4) precise; urgency=high

  [Mark Friedenbach]
    * Change behavior of the '{get,list}receivedby{address,account}'
      RPCs to show output value / sum totals calculated at refheight
      rather than at the present block height.
    * Add soft-fork to switch demurrage calculation logic to an integer math
      implementation, which sometimes differs from an exact calculation by as
      much as 1 kria. This results in an order of magnitude increase in speed
      of calculation, and allows for the future removal of the GMP and MPFR
      library dependencies.

freicoin (0.8.6~precise1) precise; urgency=high

  [Mark Friedenbach]
    * Rebase against bitcoin/0.8 stable branch of the bitcoin source tree. The
      primary feature this grabs is the BIP 66 soft-fork.
    * Add soft-fork to truncate input amounts rather than accumulate fractional
      kria. This allows for a refactoring of the code that will make future
      maintenance much easier. Packaged to deploy as part of the BIP 66
      soft-fork.
    * Update bootstrap peers and DNS seed.
    * Add checkpoint for block #153720.

freicoin (0.8.3~precise9) precise; urgency=high

  [Mark Friedenbach]
    * Rebase against v0.8.3 of the bitcoin source tree. This is a huge update,
      but we refer you to the bitcoin changelog for details.
    * Schedule hard-fork dropping pre-0.8 support after 15 December 2013.
    * Fix bug where transaction values were being shown as positive on the
      overview panel.
    * Remove support for SSLv2, since this version of the protocol has been
      removed from some distributions (notably Ubuntu) for security reasons.
      I has been disabled by default, anyway.

freicoin (0.0.2~precise4) precise; urgency=high

  [Mark Friedenbach]
    * Add the new difficulty adjustment algorithm, which replaces the simple
      average over 2016 blocks with a faster-acting 144-tap Parks and
      McClellan FIR filter, and adjustments every 9 blocks with a gain of
      0.1025 and limiter of 1.055.
    * Prepare for deployment of difficulty adjustment filter to production
      network by adding a threshold block after which the new difficulty
      adjustment algorithm takes over, for both mainnet and testnet.
    * Added Python simulator of new difficulty adjustment algorithm.
    * Fixed two related bugs in the freicoin "accounts" system. First, the
      'move' RPC command now generates AccountingEntry records with the
      current reference height rather than refheight=0. Second, the
      'listaccounts' RPC command properly time-value adjusts AccountingEntry
      records.
    * Fix unwanted transaction de-prioritization. Now calculates both inputs
      and outputs of a transaction based on the transaction's reference
      height, as opposed to the current block height, which was previously
      being used for the inputs. This was resulting in smaller (or even
      negative) fees for the purposes of priority calculation, thereby
      resulting in transactions that had trouble getting on the block chain.
    * Change nVersion on Freicoin Foundation addresses to testnet format, so
      that budgets validate correctly. This enables mining on testnet.
    * Modified output of 'getblocktemplate' RPC command to include a 'budget'
      array specifying budgetary requirements.

  [ Mark Friedenbach ]
    * JSON-RPC commands were parsing money values incorrectly--returning the
      numerical value in units of kria, not coins. This is now fixed.
    * FreicoinUnits::amountDigits() now returns the correct value (previous
      off-by-one error due to a simple arithmetic mistake).
    * Fixed logical error in ParseMoney() which was causing amounts less than
      1 COIN to be parsed in octal, leading to incorrect values or even
      abnormal program termination (if non-octal digits are encountered).

  [ Roman Mindalev ]

      non-ideal situation, but necessary until the JSON library is modified to
      handle numeric types as strings.
    * Fixed numerous serious bugs due to switch from int64 to arbitrary

freicoin (0.0.0+1beta4~precise1) precise; urgency=low

  [ Mark Friedenbach ]
    * Added a transaction-fee budget (currently empty) for possible future
      expansion. A Republicoin-like implementation for Bitcoin, for example,
      would assay taxes from the transaction-fee budget.
    * Added compatibility with nVesion=1 transactions. This is for possible
      future Bitcoin compatibility only, as it is exceedingly unlikely that
      these could ever see use on the Freicoin network.
    * Modified the transaction-generating code to take the reference height as
      a parameter, falling back on nBestHeight if it is not specified. The
      user-interface code currently passes nBestHeight without exposing
      refheight-setting functionality.
    * Examined failing tests and fixed some, removed the others that were
      specific to Bitcoin. `test_freicoin` now executes without error.
    * Created gitian release scripts for generated Linux, Windows zip, and
      Windows installer packages.
    * Updated vagrant-based gitian build process to work with new 0.7.x
      branch.
    * Black-listed updates to grub in vagrant host-vm creation script, as it
      was causing the build process to halt.

freicoin (0.0.0+1beta3~precise2) precise; urgency=low

  [ Mark Friedenbach ]
    * Created new genesis block and magic byte protocol headers for beta3
      release.
    * Implemented subsidy of charitable causes via the Freicoin Foundation,
      with a 4:1 split of the initial distribution to addresses held in escrow
      for future disbursement.
    * Lowered the monetary base to 16 digits of precision, so that amounts may
      be tracked with accuracy of a single satoshi using the decimal64 type.
    * Fixed bug where allowed coin generation values were not being compared
      at the same reference height. Due to the way Freicoin works, if
      encountered this would have only resulted in a block claiming less coins
      than it could have if it has used the correct reference height.
    * Fixed time-traveller attack, courtesy of Art Fortz.
    * Added 2nd DNS and IP seed node provided by @galambo; corrected DNS entry
      for existing seed node.

      few commits post-v0.7.1.
    * Updated DNS and IP seed lists to match current configuration.
    * Changed ClientConnectInputs API to no longer require nBlockHeight has a
      parameter.
    * Fix instances where balances were being calculated incorrectly, and
      restructured the balance code to be able to get balances as-of a
      specified reference block height.

freicoin (0.0.0+1beta2~precise2) precise; urgency=low

  [ Mark Friedenbach ]
    * Rebuilt genesis block using new transaction format (32-bit RefHeight
      instead of 64-bit), new initial block value, and new timestamp+nonce.
    * Switch to GCC 4.4.3 for Linux builds.
    * Now builds Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (lucid) packages on Ubuntu PPA.
    * Switched MPFR_ rounding constants to GMP_, for compatibility with MPFR
      2.x, for Ubuntu 10.04 LTS compatibility.
    * Switch glibc version from 2.11.1 to 2.11, for maximum compatibility.
    * Fixed choice of API for accessing Qt image data, which was an issue
      causing the Launchpad PPA to choke while building for Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
      (lucid) which includes Qt 4.6.2.
    * Fixed inaccurate representation of balances in command-line API. The
      GetAmounts() and GetAccountAmounts() wallet APIs changed in the most
      recent demurrage payback implementation, but calls to these functions
      were not updated to reflect the changes.
    * Added documentation and checks to the inclusion of "height" to
      getmemorypool.
    * Corrected monetary base magic number from 21MM to 10bn, not 21MM.
    * Change testnet protocol-header to be derived from mainnet in the same
      way as for bitcoin/bitcoin_testnet.
    * Change transaction debits/credits and other related values to be
      displayed relative to the reference height of the transaction in the Qt
      client.
    * Print the reference height as part of the detailed description of the
      transaction.
    * Added refheight field to the return value of ListTransactions() and the
      gettransaction RPC.
    * Peg amounts returned by ListTransactions() and get transaction RPC to
      the reference height of the transaction.
    * GetCredit() is supposed to take absolute height, not relative depth as
      third parameter.
    * Added a python script to calculate demurrage parameters for the
      arithmetic progression algorithm.
    * Added nRefHeight to class CAccountingEntry, and add nBlockHeight
      parameter to GetAccountCreditDebit(). (Backwards-incompatible with
      existing wallets.)
    * Added "refheight" field to output of AcentryToJSON().
    * Change nRefHeight in version=2 transactions to be 32-bit instead of 64-
      bit. Requires new genesis block.
    * Switched coinbase distribution to arithmetic progression. This will be a
      test for the second beta, with the option kept to revert before final
      release. A new genesis block still needs to be created.
    * Explicitly set genesis block's nVersion field to 2, for clarity.
    * Increased size of “About Freicoin-Qt” dialog box, to account for extra
      copyright line.
    * Added “Ref-height” column to “Transactions” tab, showing the reference
      height for the transaction, with a field for restricting transactions
      based on a specified minimum height value.
    * Added script to find genesis block.

  [ Roman Mindalev ]
    * Update port number (8333 -> 8639) in documentation and tests.
