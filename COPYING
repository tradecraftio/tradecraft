Freicoin is a fork of Bitcoin, and the Bitcoin code was licensed to
the Freicoin Developers under the terms of the MIT license (see:
mit-license.txt).

However all code added by the Freicoin Developers has copyright held
by the Freicoin Developers and is licensed only under the terms of the
GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (see: agpl-3.0.txt).

As permitted by the MIT license, the Bitcoin portions are sublicensed
for distribution under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public
License v3.0, and so the combined work is distributed under the
conjunctive terms of BOTH licenses, and BOTH licenses must be observed
for any source or binary distribution, or future fork or derived work.
