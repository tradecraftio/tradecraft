Freicoin is a fork of Bitcoin, and the Bitcoin code was licensed to the
Freicoin Developers under the terms of the MIT license (see: mit-license.txt).

However all code added by the Freicoin Developers has copyright held by the
Freicoin Developers and is licensed only under the terms of the GNU Affero
General Public License v3.0 (see: agpl-3.0.txt).

As permitted by the MIT license, the Bitcoin portions are sublicensed for
distribution under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0,
and so the combined work is distributed under the conjunctive terms of BOTH
licenses, and BOTH licenses must be observed for any source or binary
distribution, or future fork or derived work.
