/* Compilers have a bad habit of removing "superfluous" memset calls that
 * are trying to zero memory. For example, when memset()ing a buffer and
 * then free()ing it, the compiler might decide that the memset is
 * unobservable and thus can be removed.
 *
 * Previously we used OpenSSL which tried to stop this by a) implementing
 * memset in assembly on x86 and b) putting the function in its own file
 * for other platforms.
 *
 * This change removes those tricks in favour of using asm directives to
 * scare the compiler away. As best as our compiler folks can tell, this is
 * sufficient and will continue to be so.
