     * The value of an input in freicoin is adjusted based on the

     * spending reference height or the present. In order to make sure
     * that no instance gets through accidentally unconsidered, we
     * force the access of this value through getters and setters.
     *
     * Generally speaking, access to CTxOut::nValue falls into one of
     * three categories:
     *
     * 1. Historical records or reports of a transaction, which are
     *    recorded at the reference height of the transaction. The
     *    historical fact that a transaction debits 10frc from a
     *    wallet does not change over time.
     *
     * 2. Inputs to other transactions, in which case the value of the
     *    input is decayed by demurrage according to the difference
     *    between the two transactions reference heights.
     *
     * 3. Lists of unspent outputs or wallet balances, which report
     *    each unspent output as decayed to present value (the height
     *    of the next block), for coin selection and available balance
     *    purposes.
     *
     * The only odd thing worth noting is the interaction between
     * account or address views. With Freicoin the decision was made
     * that these views provide an aggregate view of historical
     * records. So if you wallet has received 100frc that is an
     * average of 1 year old, `getbalance` would return ~95frc, but
     * `listreceivedbyaddress` would show a per-address view of
     * historical amounts which if summed would yield 100frc.
