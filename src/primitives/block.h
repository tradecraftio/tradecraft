    // The CBlockHeader structure contains the native proof-of-work header,
    // which in the context of a merge-mined header we call the "compatibility"
    // proof-of-work, since it exists to serve a valid proof-of-work to nodes
    // running non-upgraded versions.
    //
    // To solve an auxiliary proof-of-work, the miner commits to a template for
    // a block within the auxiliary chain (presumably a bitcoin block).  Once a
    // solution is found for the auxiliary proof-of-work, the miner then finds a
    // satisfactory proof-of-work solution under the old rules for effectively
    // the same candidate block.
    //
    // The block template can change in only very specific, clearly enumerated
    // ways when searching for compatibility proof-of-work.  Nonetheless as a
    // result it is possible for every field of the header to be modified except
    // for the hashPrevBlock.  To reconstruct the commitment in the auxiliary
    // chain, we store the unmodified original commitment values.

    // Because of version-rolling, the miner might modify bits of nVersion field
    // of the block header.
    int32_t m_commit_version; // nVersion

    // The miner is allowed to change the scriptSig or nSequence field of the
    // coinbase transaction, which cause hashMerkleRoot to be changed.
    //
    // These fields in the coinbase transaction are the only part of the block's
    // transaction data which the miner is allowed to alter when searching for
    // the compatibility proof-of-work.  The original values are stored in the
    // block itself, and here we store only the root hash of the unmodified
    // transaction Merkle tree.
    uint256 m_commit_hash_merkle_root; // hashMerkleRoot

    // This field is used to store the difficulty adjustment filter prediction
    // for the prior block, rather than any time value.
    uint32_t m_commit_time; // nTime

    // The current difficulty of the auxiliary and compatibility proof-of-work
    // schemes are different and disconnected, of course.  This is the auxiliary
    // proof-of-work difficulty for the merge-mined block (which is different
    // than the auxiliary block's stated difficulty!).
    uint32_t m_commit_bits; // nBits

    // Obviously the compatibility proof-of-work overwrites the nNonce field.
    // In the block template, which otherwise has no use for this field, we use
    // nNonce to store the bias value (1 byte) and difficulty adjustment filter
    // state (3 bytes).
    uint32_t m_commit_nonce; // nNonce

    //
    // The above 5 values, combined with the hashPrevBlock which is shared with
    // the compatibility proof-of-work and therefore stored in CBlockHeader,
    // form the block template commitment.  The next step is to locate the
    // commitment within the auxiliary block's transaction data:
    //

    // To eliminate block witholding attacks, the merge mining is split across
    // two proof of work checks: the first is a regular PoW check using nonce
    // values picked by the miner, and the second is a salted hash keyed by a
    // secret value chosen in advance by the mining pool server and not told
    // to the miner.  In this way the miner is able to check if they have a
    // candidate block worth submitting to the mining pool for credit, but
    // cannot know discover whether the solution they hold is a valid block
    // or not without submitting it to the server.
    //
    // The mining server's secret is a random 128-bit value, which we store as
    // two 64-bit integers.
    uint64_t m_secret_lo;
    uint64_t m_secret_hi;

    //
    // The above fields combine together to generate the merge mining
    // commitment in the following way:
    //
    //   commitment = H(H2(block_header) || H2(m_secret_lo || m_secret_hi))
    //
    // Where H() is the fast Merkle tree hash and H2() is double-SHA256.
    //
    // In other words, the commitment is 1 levels down the left-hand side of a
    // fast Merkle tree, while the right-hand side SKIP hash is a commitment to
    // the block witholding secret.
    //

    // The merge mining commitment is aggregated with other commitments in the
    // auxiliary block using a Merkle hash map structure.  The key is fixed for
    // this chain, so we need only store the skip hash and number of compressed
    // bits for each level.
    std::vector<std::pair<unsigned char, uint256> > m_commit_branch;

    // The merged mining commitment is stored in the last bytes of the last
    // output of the last transaction in the auxiliary block.  This permits us
    // to compress the auxiliary block's final transaction to the midstate of
    // the SHA256 hash of the transaction, right up to the point of the merge
    // mining commitment.  This midstate is the intermediate hash value (or
    // the IV value if a full block of data hasn't been accumulated), the
    // bytes of the next compression block which have been aggregated so far,
    // and a numeric count of the total number of bytes that have been
    // hashed so far (including those in the midstate buffer).

    // block.  This has no consensus meaning in our block chain, but must be
    // part of the proof because it follows the commitment.
    uint32_t m_aux_lock_time;

    //
    // The block-final transaction of the commitment is calculated by
    // initializing a CSHA256 instance with the midstate data, then feeding the

    //
    // With the block-final hash as the leaf value, the branch is used to
    // calculate the hashMerkleRoot of the auxiliary block's block header.
    // The other fields of the auxiliary block header must be stored
    // explicitly:
    //

    int32_t m_aux_version;         // nVersion
    uint256 m_aux_hash_prev_block; // hashPrevBlock
    uint32_t m_aux_bits;           // nBits
    uint32_t m_aux_nonce;          // nNonce

    //
    // To be compatible with mining bitcoin, the goal of an individual miner
    // must be to find a combination of nonce/timestamp/extranonce values
    // which cause the bitcoin block, the auxiliary block header from our
    // perspective, to have a low hash value.
    //
    // However to prevent block witholding attacks, and to randomize the
    // arrival time of our blocks with respect to bitcoin's (or shard blocks
    // as defined in the proposed Forward Blocks extension), the proof-of-work
    // is split between the auxiliary block hash, ground by the miner, and the
    // per-chain salted hash checked server-side.  The secondary proof-of-work
    // is defined as:
    //
    //   H(H(<genesis hash> || m_secret_lo || m_secret_hi) ||
    //     H(<genesis hash> || m_secret_lo || m_secret_hi) ||
    //     <auxiliary block header>)
    //
    // Where H() in this case is standard SHA-256.  This result must have at
    // least `bias` leading zero bits to be valid merge-mined proof-of-work.
    //

    //
    // Finally, to make this a soft-fork it is required that the winning block
    // have known substitutions of miner-adjustable values which allow it to
    // satisfy the proof-of-work requirements under the old rules to ensure
    // compatibility with non-upgraded noded.  Those substitutions are the
    // values found in CBlockHeader.
