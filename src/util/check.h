 * Throw a NonFatalCheckError when the condition evaluates to false
 *
 * This should only be used
 * - where the condition is assumed to be true, not for error handling or validating user input
 * - where a failure to fulfill the condition is recoverable and does not abort the program
 *
 * For example in RPC code, where it is undersirable to crash the whole program, this can be generally used to replace
 * asserts or recoverable logic errors. A NonFatalCheckError in RPC code is caught and passed as a string to the RPC
 * caller, which can then report the issue to the developers.
